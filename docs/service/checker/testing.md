# Testing the Checker

> This page is still under construction.

We have a testing Library for testing any checker implementation: https://github.com/enowars/enochecker_test

You can add it to your repository with this `.github/workflows/enochecker_test.yml`

You can manually check whether your checker is working with the [CLI](https://github.com/enowars/enochecker_cli).
